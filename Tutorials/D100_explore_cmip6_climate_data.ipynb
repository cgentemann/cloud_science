    "## Basic idea: evidence for climate change illustrated from one dataset, analyzed/visualized with xarray. \n",
    "Learning objectives:\n",
    "- Introduce them to basic physical mechanisms of climate change and the evidence we see in the data.\n",
    "- Show the power of the stack they know about for thinking about climate change, and grow their knowledge about that stack.\n",
    "- Expose students to data represented with structures other than tabular dataframes. Learn a little about xarray for querying/analysis.\n",
    "- Discuss data with spatial and/or temporal structure.\n",
    "- Illustrate the relationship between models grounded in physics and the kinds of data we have access to from simulations, field sensors and remote sensing.\n"
